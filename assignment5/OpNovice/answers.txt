Example OpNovice
----------------------------

1. Average number of scintillation photons created per event: 67.3 +- 8.78

2. Average number of scintillation photons created per event: 21.9 +- 4.8
Average number of optical absorption interactions per event: 9.36 +- 3.16

3. 50 MeV^-1 (OpNoviceDetectorConstruction - line 140)

4. Fast time constant: 1 ns; slow time constant: 10 ns

5. Average number of optical absorption interactions per event: 22.2 +- 5.22; this is higher than the 9.36 average from Part 2,
with significantly larger absorption lengths. After conceptually understanding what absoprtion lengths for scintillators are, more absorptions is consistent
with shorter absorption lengths.
